# SQL deforestation project

In this project, I do research in 3 different parts based on the data provided.

1. Global Situation ( first i find the total number of countries involved in deforestation).
2. Regional Outlook ( I check the income bracket of these countries in correlation to the average area per Square kilometer.
3. Country-Level Detail ( I look for the top 5 countries having the highest total forest areas from each region).
